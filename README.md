# Chatting-Application

## Programming Language
Java

## Description
This project involves developing a Java-based TCP chatting application where a client connects to a server using the command 'CONNECT' to establish a socket connection. Once connected, text input at either end is displayed on the other side, facilitating bi-directional communication. The client and server operate on separate machines connected via WLAN or a hotspot. The server's IPv4 address is specified in the client code, and both the client and server use the same TCP port for communication.
